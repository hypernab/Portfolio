Welcome to my webpage
My name is Hypernab
Theres a lot I could put up here
But I dont know if I should.
Although if you want to type something
feel free to go ahead and press backspace on this text and type whatever you like.
This is a mirror afterall.
Speaking of mirrors I think I kinda like them.
Mirrors are like silent observers of our existence and act as metaphysical portals into the depths of our consciousness.
They reveal the duality of existence, blurring the lines between self and other, truth and
illusion.
Sometimes I look at it for hours and see an entity both eerie and strangely familiar.
Its reflection is a relentless whisper in the abyss of self, revealing the unsettling duality
of existence.
Sometimes I want to experience the boundaries between self and other blur into something
perhaps I dont know what it could be.
But hey an experience is an experience
